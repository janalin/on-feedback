After a scientific talk, we have
questions
a scientific debate
feedback on the talk

This is about feedback.
This is not about how to ask or answer questions. 
This is not about how to have a scientific debate.
Yet, guiding principles overlap, of course.


Learn the art of giving feedback in 5 minutes
This is impossible
Let's try instead
Get started with effective feedback in 5 minutes

There is always feedback to give.
What makes feedback effective?

Effective feedback is
Concrete: don't do 'it's nice' or 'i didn't get it'. instead what did you like, where did you get lost, provide always a why. if you are the presenter, ask for why. 

Things to try:

Things to try to distinguish between
science -> content
structure, language, slides, and diagrams -> clarity
presenter 

Listen actively 
Ask yourself:
If you got lost, why?
If you got interested, why?
(If you got angry, why?)

Effective feedback is constructive

Things to try 
combine with a call for action.
For instance
what to keep: continue doing
what to stop: 
what to start: 


Effective feedback is concise
How to be concise
concise:  avoid repeting others. prioritize feedback. adjust priorities to speaker's skillset and scope of the talk. 


Giving good feedback is as difficult as making good talks.
You automatically learn to 
reflect on the content, think critically, search for gaps, become aware of jargon, scientific pitfals
what makes slides, diagrams, and plots appealing and comprehensive
what makes a good structure, a good start, and ending
good talks are focused & audience-centric -> if you sit in the audience you know what I mean.

We're not done yet.

If you receive feedback
Listen - do not defend yourself. You are free to disagree.
Aswer
Ask - whas it concrete enough?
Thank - a feedback is a gift.

And please...

n whatever side of the room you are
Be patient and relax.
Agree to disagree. 
I'm OK.
You're OK.
